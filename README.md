# sipay.bootcamp.gamze-nur-madan.assignment-1
First Assignment Project for Sipay Bootcamp<br />
The assignment's purpose is to teach the basic use of Fluent Validation Library.<br />
The assignment is done with best practices in mind. <br />
Person Entity class is under the Models folder and Validation Rules for said class is under Validators Folders.<br />
Since the Fluent Validation Library does not have any Phone built-in validator, phone property is only checked with NotEmpty() validator. <br />
Additional error messages are added per validators for better understanding.<br />
